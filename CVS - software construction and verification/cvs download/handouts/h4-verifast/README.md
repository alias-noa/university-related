# Fourth handout CVS 2018/2019

For the fourth handout, you must implement and specify a concurrent 
queue by wrapping a queue implemented and verified in handout 3. You
should discipline the exclusive access to the sequentional implementation 
of the queue by means of a monitor and corresponding conditions.

You must implement and verify a main method that launches a given number 
of threads that "produce" an integer value and another N threads that "consume" 
an integer value from the queue. As an example N can be 50.

Use the approach that was taken in the lectures and lab assignments.
