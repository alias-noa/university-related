For the third handout, you must implements and specify a queue.
A skeleton (class and method signatures) is provided in __Queue.java__
In this file, it is also provided the queue invariant. You can use this
invariant to write your own specifications, i.e., the methods' pre
and post conditions.

Hint: try to keep your specifications simple and avoid introducing
more array_slice predicates. Also, avoid using modulooperations
(x % y), use branches instead.
