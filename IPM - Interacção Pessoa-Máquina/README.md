## Project description
Carris.pt is a website with public transportation informations in Lisbon, like
timetables, network map and route simulator. Unfortunately this website is not too
user friendly. The main goal of this project is to create a more suitable solution for users to search
in a convenient way for transportation timetables of their choosing.
